- haversine v2.3.0 - Supports the use of haversine
- geodistance.py : This is the splunk reporting command introduced by this app
- enum34 v1.1.10 : Required by on Python 2.4-3.3 when using haversine


#### Release notes

##### About this release

Version 1.2.0 of the SA-geodistance is compatible with:

| Splunk Enterprise versions | 6.x, 7.x, 8.x |
| --- | --- |
| CIM | Not Applicable |
| Platforms | Platform independent |
| Lookup file changes | No lookups included in this app |

##### New features

SA-geodistance includes the following new features:

##### Fixed issues

This version includes support for Python v3 and Splunk v8.x. The distance returned by default is in kilometers.

This version of the SA-geodistance doesnt introduce any fixes and simply updates the permission of python files so it's not executable.

## INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

### Hardware and software requirements

#### Hardware requirements

SA-geodistance supports the following server platforms in the versions supported by Splunk Enterprise:

- Linux
- Windows

The app was developed to be platform agnostic, but tests are mostly run on unix.
Please contact the developer with issues running this on Windows.

#### Software requirements

To function properly, SA-geodistance has no external requirements but needs to be installed on a full Splunk install
which provides python and the basic math libraries needed.


#### Splunk Enterprise system requirements

Because this add-on runs on Splunk Enterprise, all of the [Splunk Enterprise system requirements](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/Systemrequirements) apply.

#### Download

Download the SA-geodistance at [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3232/) OR [GitHub](https://github.com/seunomosowon/SA-geodistance).

#### Installation steps

To install and configure this app on your supported standalone platform, do one of the following:

- Install on a standalone search head via the GUI (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Singleserverinstall)
- Extract the app to ```$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/``` and restart Splunk

For a supported distributed environment, follow the steps to install the SA-geodistance on the search head only.

For a clustered search head environment, install SA-geodistance via the search head deployer.

More instructions available at the following [URL] (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/Distributedinstall)

For Splunk cloud installations, follow the instructions present at the following [link] (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/AddOns/released/Overview/SplunkCloudinstall)


## USER GUIDE

### Key concepts for SA-geodistance

<code>
<base_search> | geodistance latfield=<field> longfield=<field> output_field=<field>
                miles=<bool> group_by=<group> haversine=<bool>
</code>

This app can return distances as miles or kilometer (default).  To return distances in miles,
pass the `miles=True` as an argument to the command.

It computes the vincenty distances by default. To use haversine instead, add the paramter `haversine=True` or `haversine=T`

It can also compute the adjacent distances for different groups by passing the grouping criteria, `group_by=group`.
This currently supports grouping by a single field. A future update will support grouping by multiple fields.

* Note: The first event in the result will also have a distance of 0.0

* Events that do not have latitudes or longitudes, as is the output when geocoding private non-routed IP addresses,
     will be given a distance of 0.0. The next relative distance will still be based on last public address found.


#### Example 1

This can be used to easily obtain the distance between multiple VPN authentication attempts
which could indicate a compromise where relative distances are above a maximum/expected commutable distance.

```
index=vpn | stats count by src_ip , user |
iplocation src_ip |
fields src_ip, user, lat, lon  |
geodistance latfield=lat longfield=lon output_field=distance group_by=user
```

#### Example 2

This example has been written around the sample app that comes with Splunk.
THis example was carried out using the data generated by the sample app that ships disabled with Splunk Enterprise.

This search extracts the clientip field from the relay field,
and geocodes using the inbuilt iplocation search command.

The relative distance in (Km) of each adjacent event is then computed using the `geodistance` command.

S1:
```
	index=sample | rex field=relay \"\[(?<clientip>.*)\]\" |
	iplocation clientip | table lat lon clientip |
	geodistance latfield=lat longfield=lon output_field=distance miles=True
```

S2:
```
	index=sample | rex field=relay "\[(?<clientip>.*)\]" |
		iplocation clientip | table clientip lat lon| search lat=* |
		geodistance latfield=lat longfield=lon output_field=distance group_by=clientip
```

**Note**: the relative distance between all events with the same clientip will be zero


S3:
```
	index=sample | rex field=relay "\[(?<clientip>.*)\]" |
		iplocation clientip | table clientip lat lon from | search lat=* |
	 	geodistance latfield=lat longfield=lon output_field=distance group_by=from | dedup from distance
```


### Data types

This app outputs the relative distance into the field specified in output_field parameter.


### Configure SA-geodistance

This app has no configurations.

### Troubleshoot SA-geodistance

The command writes logs to `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/SA-geodistance.log```.
This can be seen by searching your internal index using ```index=_internal source=*SA-geodistance.log```.


-- To enable debug logging for the geodistance command, add the following to ```SA-geodistance/local/logging.conf```

```
[logger_GeoDistanceCommand]
level = DEBUG
```


### Upgrade SA-geodistance
This app supports in-place upgrade of older verisons. Alternatively, remove older versions before installing the newest version.
